## Description

A lightweight but effective note-taking application, written as an exercise in working with servers, integrating multiple JavaScript files, and creating file structures for a live web environment.
I was provided with the front-facing code included in the 'public' file, and wrote the back-end to effectively pass data between the client and server.

## Installation

First, download or clone this repository from Github. Second, run 'npm install' from your terminal inside the application directory to install the required node modules. The app can be run on a local server by running the server.js file through node, or hosted on a cloud platform such as Heroku.

## Usage

From the homepage, click get started to access the notes interface. Once a note title and text have been entered, a save button will appear in the top right. Saved notes appear in the left column. Click on a note to view it. Click on the pencil icon in the top right to open a new note. Click on a note's trash icon in the sidebar to (permanently!) delete it.

## Contributing

Feel free to branch the repository if you wish to make personal modifications to the code.

## Tests

I tested this application through heavy use. Enter notes, check them, and delete them to ensure there are no issues in accessing or rendering individual notes.
